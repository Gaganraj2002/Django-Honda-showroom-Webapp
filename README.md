This project is more like a template project(I hope this should be useful to you) for a ecommerce website.

install it using "pip install pipenv"<br>
To initialize the pipenv<br>
To activate the environment, just navigate to your project directory and use pipenv shell to launch a new shell session or use pipenv run <command> to run a command directly.
